# Data Science Projects


In this repository you can find projects I've worked on while transitioning from a civil engineer to a data scientist.

Projects cover different problems solved using exploratory data analisys, data visualisation, machine learning and beyond.

[Client churn prediction](https://github.com/gulshart/DS-Projects/tree/main/Bank%20client's%20churn%20) This project aims to predict whether a client will leave Beta Bank in the near future using historical data on customer behavior and contract termination.    

[Determine the age from photos ](https://github.com/gulshart/DS-Projects/tree/main/Determine%20the%20customers's%20age) Implementing a computer vision system to process customer photos and determine their age.   

[https://github.com/gulshart/DS-Projects/tree/main/Hypothesis%20testing%20](Hipothesis testing) Choosing a user plan for a scooter rental company.  

[https://github.com/gulshart/DS-Projects/tree/main/Mobile%20plan%20choice](Mobile plan recommendation) A machine learning model to recommend the appropriate data plan.  
  
[https://github.com/gulshart/DS-Projects/tree/main/Oil%20well%20lication%20selection](Selection of a location for oil well). Application of a machine lerning model to make a decision on a location of oil wells.  

[https://github.com/gulshart/DS-Projects/tree/main/Rush%20hour%20prediction](Rush hour prediction)  Predicting the number of taxi orders for the next hour using time series  

[https://github.com/gulshart/DS-Projects/tree/main/Steel%20melting%20temperature%20prediction](Steel melting temperature prediction) A model that predicts the temperature of steel melting alloys.

[https://github.com/gulshart/DS-Projects/tree/main/Toxic%20comments%20detection](Detecting Toxic Comments for an Online Shop)  Implementation of a LLM to detect toxic comments

[https://github.com/gulshart/DS-Projects/tree/main/User%20data%20encryption](Protection of Clients' Personal Data) Encryption of users' data and mathematical proof of that a prediction results wont be affected by encryption.
