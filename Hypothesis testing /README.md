# GoFast Scooter Rental Business Growth Analysis #

## Project Overview #
This project aims to analyze user data from the GoFast scooter rental service to test hypotheses that can help the business grow. 
The analysis focuses on user behavior, trip details, and subscription types to provide actionable recommendations for the business.

## Introduction #
GoFast is a scooter rental service that operates in several cities. Users can travel around the city using a mobile application. The service is available with two pricing models: without a subscription and with an Ultra subscription.

## Problem Statement #
Data was obtained about users of the GoFast service, their trips, and subscriptions. The goal is to analyze this data and test hypotheses that could help the business grow. Specifically, the analysis seeks to understand user behavior patterns and the financial impact of subscription types.

## Data Description #
The dataset consists of three files:

- users_go.csv: Information about users, their trips, and subscriptions.
-rides_go.csv: Information about trips, including duration, distance, and cost.
- subscriptions_go.csv: Information about subscriptions, including start and end dates.

## Conclusion
Data was provided from scooter rental service GoFast from several cities, including data on duration, distance, cost of the trip and type of subscription (free/ultra). After reviewing the data, duplicates were removed and the data type was converted to time. Next, the data was divided into two categories, depending on the type of subscription and collected by month. Afterwards, the monthly revenue for each user was calculated and the data was aggregated by subscription type.

Hypotheses for carrying out the action were tested. Based on the tests performed, we can conclude that:

users of paid subscriptions spend more time traveling.
the average travel distance of a user with a subscription does not exceed 3130m.
Subscribed users bring in more revenue.
## Recommendation for the business:##  
Promotions should be carried out aimed at increasing the number of paid accounts.
