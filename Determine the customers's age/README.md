## Determining the age of customers using computer vision
The Bread-Sol supermarket chain is implementing a computer vision system to process customer photos. 
Photo recording in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to: Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group; Monitor the integrity of cashiers when selling alcohol. 
It is necessary to build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. There is a set of photographs of people with an indication of age.
